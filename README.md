==============================================================================================

========================================
OBJECTIVE AND SUB TASK DETAILS OF TASK1:
========================================

The primary goal of the Task1 is to perform Comparative Analysis on Supervised Machine 
Learning-Classification Algorithms on Electrical-Grid Simulated Data downloaded from 
UCI Machine Learning repository to Predict the power stability through Classification 
ML Algorithms(ieeexplore.ieee.org, n.d.) in two ways

TASK1 is divided into two main Parts:
TASK-A and TASK-B.


Task-A: Experimented Two Supervised ML classification Algorithms using Python PL
(Programming-Language) in Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab. 

...TaskA.1: Experimented using K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) classifier-model.
...Implemented Python Code in the Jupyter notebook: "komala_class_knn_elecgrid.ipynb"


...TaskA.2: Experimented using Neural Network model on the Tenserflow Library using Keras API. 
...Implemented Python Code in the Jupyter notebook: "komala_class_nueralnet_elecgrid.ipynb"


Task-B: Experimented Neural Network and DecisionTree classification on ElectricalGrid 
dataset ML algorithms using Azure Machine Learning Pipeline Designer of Azure ML studio 
configured using Student Account(Tso and Yau, 2007).

...TaskB.1: Experimented using Two-Class Neural Network model in the Azure pipeline Designer
...TaskB.2: Experimented using Two-Class Decision Forest model in the Azure pipeline Designer
No Code file for Task-B. Only Screenshots of above Two Executed Tasks are presented in the Report.
